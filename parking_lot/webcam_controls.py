"""Hardware-level webcam controls.

This module is a thin wrapper around ``cv2.VideoCapture.set`` for the
``CAP_PROP_*`` properties that correspond to V4L2 controls (brightness,
contrast, exposure, etc.). Setting a value here is roughly equivalent to
running, on Linux::

    v4l2-ctl --set-ctrl=brightness=192

before opening the camera. On other platforms, OpenCV routes the same
calls through the platform's native camera API (DirectShow on Windows,
AVFoundation on macOS).

Note that not every camera/driver exposes every control. ``set`` returns
``False`` when the device rejects a property; we log a warning in that
case rather than failing the run.

    """Closed-loop adjuster for a webcam's hardware brightness/exposure.

    Computes the mean luminance of each incoming frame and nudges a single
    hardware control up or down to keep that mean near ``target``. This is
    essentially a software auto-exposure that drives V4L2 controls instead
    of doing it in pixels.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target : float
        Desired mean luminance (0–255). 128 is neutral midtone.
    tolerance : float
        Dead-zone around ``target`` where no adjustment happens. Prevents
        oscillation on noisy frames.
    step : float
        Maximum change to the control value per adjustment. Multiplied by
        the normalized error, so the actual step shrinks as we approach
        the target.
    interval : float
        Minimum number of seconds between adjustments. Webcams need a few
        frames after a control change to settle, so adjusting every frame
        causes overshoot.
    prop : str or None
        Which control to drive. One of ``"exposure"``, ``"gain"``,
        ``"brightness"``, or ``None`` to auto-detect on the first frame.
    value_range : tuple of (float, float) or None
        Min/max value the chosen control accepts. Auto-detected if None.
